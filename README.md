# HC news
the HC version of JRMU news.

everyday since 2021 I've been sharing the JRMUNEWS to a group of friends of mine. it is a big text with the holidays that are celebrated that day, news, stock market, sports and etc... kinda like a RSS feed but worse

I love the JRMUNEWS but it is kinda bloated... so this is a bunch of bash scripts stiched togheter to make a more focused version of it

also it is open source.
